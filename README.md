*Yet another boring website on the Internet, I guess...*

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/73730c94-7f54-47c9-bd39-054054829340/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/wonderfall-dev/deploys)

This is my current English website, built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (theme is [WonderMod](https://github.com/Wonderfall/hugo-WonderMod)) and currently hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Please don't mind the commit history, I'm a lazy person.
